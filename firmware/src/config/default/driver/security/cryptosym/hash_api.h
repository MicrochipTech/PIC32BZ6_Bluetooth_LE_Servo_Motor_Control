 /* Examples:
 * The following examples show typical sequences of function calls for hashing
 * a message.
   @code
   1. Single-call hash computation
       CRM_HASH_CREATE(ctx, &crmhashalg_sha2_256, ctxsize)
       CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 1')
       CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 2')
       CRM_HASH_DIGEST(ctx)
       CRM_HASH_WAIT(ctx)
   2. Context-saving hash computation
       First round:
           CRM_HASH_CREATE(ctx, &crmhashalg_sha2_256, ctxsize)
           CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 1 of first round')

           CRM_HASH_SAVE_STATE(ctx)
           CRM_HASH_WAIT(ctx)
       Intermediary rounds:
           CRM_HASH_RESUME_STATE(ctx)
           CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 1 of round i')
           CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 2 of round i')

           CRM_HASH_SAVE_STATE(ctx)
           CRM_HASH_WAIT(ctx)
       Last round:
           CRM_HASH_RESUME_STATE(ctx)
           CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 1 of last round')
           CRM_HASH_FEED(ctx, 'chunk 2 of last round')
