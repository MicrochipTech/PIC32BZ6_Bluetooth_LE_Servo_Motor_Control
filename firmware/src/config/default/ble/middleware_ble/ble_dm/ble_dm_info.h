  Device Information Middleware Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    ble_dm_info.h

  Summary:
    Defines the interface for Device Information submodule within the BLE Device
    Manager module.

  Description:
    This header specifies the functions and data structures used by the BLE
    Device Manager to handle Device Information. It
    is intended for internal use within the BLE middleware stack.
