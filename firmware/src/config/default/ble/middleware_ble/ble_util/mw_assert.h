  Middleware Assert Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    mw_assert.h

  Summary:
    Defines the middleware assertion functionality.

  Description:
    This header file declares the assertion macros and functions used by
    middleware components to validate assumptions during runtime. If an
    assertion fails, it can aid in identifying incorrect program behavior
    early in the development cycle.

/**
 * @brief Asserts that a condition is true at compile time.
 *
 * This macro implements a static assertion mechanism that checks a condition
 * during compilation. If the condition is false, it will cause a compile-time
 * error due to the negative size array declaration. This is useful for
 * enforcing constraints that can be verified during compilation rather than at
 * runtime.
 *
 * @param[in] check The compile-time condition that should be true.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *     MW_ASSERT(sizeof(int) == 4);
 * @endcode
