  BLE Database Discovery Middleware Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    ble_dd.h

  Summary:
    Defines the interface for the BLE Database Discovery module.

  Description:
    This header file exposes the BLE Database Discovery module's API and associated events
    to the application layer. The module is responsible for discovering services and
    characteristics on a remote BLE device. Users must invoke "BLE_DD_Init" within the
    "APP_Initialize" function to properly initialize this module before use.
