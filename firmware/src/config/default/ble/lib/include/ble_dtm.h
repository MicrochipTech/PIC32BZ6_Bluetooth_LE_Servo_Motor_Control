  BLE DTM Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    ble_dtm.h

  Summary:
    This header file defines the BLE DTM interface functions for the application developer.

  Description:
    This header file declares the BLE DTM interface functions and events for the application developer.
    The "BLE_DTM_Init" function must be invoked within the "APP_Initialize" function to
    initialize this module within the system. This setup is necessary for conducting
    RF tests in compliance with the Bluetooth RF-PHY Test Specifications.
